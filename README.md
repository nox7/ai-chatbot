# Sapphire Intelligence (NodeJS Chatbot)
Sapphire is an upcoming chat intelligence that is written-language independent. Theoretically, it can learn and use any written language that it processes.

Sapphire works with a graphical database (Neo4j) to make relations between words and chains of words. Sapphire can detect atmospheric moods, has a personal mood, and attempts to read the polarity and tone of sentences. These factors give Sapphire the opportunity to learn to respond accordingly based on word chains (sentences/fragments) it has learned. 

Like a child, Sapphire will learn what you write to it and learn moods and connotations thanks to the easy neural interface of Neo4j. Over time, a large graphical database can be created which makes up an individual through each Sapphire instance (meaning every chat bot can be made unique).

The missing key in most chatbots, besides emotion and mood reading, is desire. Sapphire can be set to have desires - or dynamic desires based on eventual implementation of hormones. This will lead the Intelligence to want to satisfy those desires by attempting to attain certain moods in conversation (good, bad, flirty, demeaning, etc).
